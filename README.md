Random_fu 
=========

A Ruby gem to add random capability.  Currently, only for Strings, Hashes and Time.  Tested with 
ruby 1.9.2 and RSpec 2.10.  Note, classes are monkey patched by adding "random" and "random_foo"
instance methods to Ruby classes. 

DO NOT USE for generating any data related to security!!!  
---------------------------------------------------------
There are better, more secure, methods for this.  This gem is meant ONLY for non secure
random strings.

Installation
============

Random_fu will is distributed as a ruby gem.  Simply require it in your Gemfile.

    gem "random_fu"

## Usage

## Strings
----------
## String#random_order

Returns a random string created from the characters in the string.  Characters in the string are used only once, and the result
will be the same length.  The result is simply a jumbled version.

### Examples:

    "abc".random_order
    # => "cba"
    
    "abcdef".random_order[0]    # Random letter between a and f
    # => "b"

    "abcdef".random_order[0,2]  # Two random letters between a and f
    # => "eb"

## String#random(count)

Returns a random string the size of count created from the characters in the string.  Characters are used one or more times, and
characters may repeat and/or not be used at all.  The source string is just a list of possible characters (to place a 
string in a random order, use String#random_order).  For example, "abcd".random(n) could result in 
just one letter used multiple times:

     "abcd".random(2)
     # => "dd"

### Examples:

To produce a random character from the alphabet:

    "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".random(1)
    # => "d"

    ("a".."z").to_a.join.random(1)
    # => "j"

To produce a 20 character random string from the alphabet:

    "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".random(20)
    # => "ijvrvddrwgucdsyzybfq"

## Hashs
--------------
## Hash#random
Returns the value from a random key.  If called on an empty hash, returns nil.

### Examples:

    hash = { first_base: 'fred', second_base: 'tom', pitcher: 'jen' }
    hash.random
    # => "jen"
    
    {}.random
    # => nil

## Time
--------------
## Time#random_between(Time)
Returns a Time object which is random between self and the Time object passed in. 
Note, the Time returned MAY be equal to self or the Time passed in!  Lower and 
Upper bound times are possible values, just like 0 and 1 are between?(0,1) in Ruby.

### Examples:

    t=Time.now
    # => 2012-06-27 13:57:02 -0500
    t2 = t + 60
    # => 2012-06-27 13:58:02 -0500
    t.random_between(t2)
    # => 2012-06-27 13:57:17 -0500

    t=Time.new(2012,6,1)
    # => 2012-06-01 00:00:00 -0500
    t2=Time.new(2012,6,30)
    # => 2012-06-30 00:00:00 -0500
    t.random_between(t2)
    # => 2012-06-09 20:01:45 -0500
